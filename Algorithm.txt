Problem 1: Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers:
Start 
Get the value of n from the user
Set a variable sum to 0.
Loop through numbers from 1 to n
For each number i, add i to sum
Display the value of sum
End

Problem 2: Check for Prime Number:
Start
Get the value of n from the user
If n is less than or equal to 1, it is not a prime number
For numbers from 2 to sqrt(n)
check if n is divisible by any of these numbers
If it is divisible by any number, it is not a prime
Display whether the number is prime or not
End

Problem 3: Find the Maximum of Three Numbers:
Start
Get the values of a, b, and c from the user
Compare a with b and c to find the largest
If a is greater than both b and c, then a is the largest
If b is greater than both a and c, then b is the largest
Otherwise, c will be the largest
Display the largest value
End

Problem 4: Factorial Calculation:
Start
Get the value of n from the user
If n=0, return 1, because 0!=1
Set a variable result to 1 
Loop through numbers from 1 to n, and multiply each number by result
Display the result
End

Problem 5: Check if a Number is Even or Odd:
Start
Get the value of n from the user
If n%2==0, then n is even
Otherwise, n is odd
Display "Even" or "Odd" based on the result
End
