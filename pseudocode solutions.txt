Problem 1: Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers

BEGIN
    INPUT n
    SET sum = 0
    FOR i = 1 TO n DO
        sum = sum + i
    END FOR
    PRINT sum
END

Problem 2: Check for Prime Number

BEGIN
    INPUT n
    IF n <= 1 THEN
        PRINT n, "is not a prime number."
        EXIT
    FOR i = 2 TO âˆšn + 1
        IF n MOD i = 0 THEN
            PRINT n, "is not a prime number."
            EXIT
        END IF
    END FOR
    PRINT n, "is a prime number."
END

Problem 3: Find the Maximum of Three Numbers

BEGIN
    INPUT a
    INPUT b
    INPUT c
    IF a >= b AND a >= c THEN
        PRINT "The largest number is ", a
    ELSE IF b >= a AND b >= c THEN
        PRINT "The largest number is ", b
    ELSE
        PRINT "The largest number is ", c
    END IF
END

Problem 4: Factorial Calculation

BEGIN
    INPUT n
    SET factorial = 1
